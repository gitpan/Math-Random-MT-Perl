Math-Random-MT-Perl version 1.00
================================

Pure Perl implementation of the Mersenne Twister algorithm as implemented in
C/XS in Math::Random::MT. The Mersenne Twister is a 32 bit pseudorandom number
generator developed by Makoto Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura.

The interface is the same as that of Math::Random::MT with the proviso that
seeding with multiple seeds is not supported. The output is identical to the
C/XS version. The tests are straight out of Math::Random::MT.

SPEED

Runs around 1/3-1/2 as fast as Math::Random::MT, however that still means a
Benchmark random number generation speed of 100,000/sec on modest hardware,
so this is unlikely to cause a significant bottleneck in most circumstances.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Substitute nmake for make on Win32.

DEPENDENCIES
