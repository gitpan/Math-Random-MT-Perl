Revision history for Perl extension Math::Random::MT::Perl.

1.00  Tue May 20 17:03:16 2008
    - original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
        -AX Math::Random::MT::Perl

1.01  Thur May 22
    - implemented array of seeds to complete compatability with C version
    - added script validate.pl to /t which "proves" output identical to C
      where proves means produces the same output over > 10e8 runs
    - added extra test to 5.t that demonstrated an issue with array laver

1.02 Fri May 23
    - implemented & 0xffffffff where required to constrain integers to
      32 bits on 64 bit systems. thanks to almut from perlmonks for the
      testing and the solution.

1.03 Sat May 24
    - patched test files to limit floating point to 12 sig figures and avoid
      spurious test failures on 64 bit systems which return longer floating
      point numbers that 32 bit builds (18 digits vs 15).with underlying
      integers from 0..2**32-1 there are actually only 10 sig figs.
    - reversed the ok(expected,got) test format acquired from
      Math::Random::MTto the correct ok(got,expected) order so the test
      failures read correctly.
